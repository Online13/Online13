### Hi there 👋

🤵 Exploring interface design and creation, when I was studying
mathematics in my first year, was an exceptional adventure, and I
haven't stopped since.💡 In parallel, I've been lucky enough to work on
projects where I've gained experience with **React**, **Node Js**, **Python**, and **Typescript**.

🎓 Now I'm preparing my final year intership at the LIMA Laboratory. In
my spare time, I work on personal project and take part in hackathons.

🏓 My hobbies are drawing, playing chess, playing video games, and
manga.
